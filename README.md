OVERVIEW OF JOB BOARD

A job board is essentially an online marketplace that connects employers with potential employees. Here's a quick rundown of how it works:

For Employers:

Post jobs: They can advertise job openings by creating detailed descriptions with requirements and responsibilities.
Find talent: Job boards give access to a large pool of candidates from various backgrounds and skillsets.
Manage applications: Some boards offer features to streamline the application process, like collecting resumes and filtering candidates.

For Job Seekers:

Search for jobs: Look for opportunities based on their interests, experience, location, and other criteria using filters.
Apply for jobs: Submit applications directly through the job board, often with the option to upload resumes.
Find career resources: Many job boards offer additional resources like resume-building tools or career advice.

Types of Job Boards:

General job boards: These boards cover a wide range of industries and positions (Indeed, LinkedIn).
Niche job boards: These boards specialize in specific industries or professions (Dice for tech jobs, Monster for blue-collar jobs).

Benefits:

Efficiency: Saves time and effort for both employers and job seekers by centralizing the search process.
Wider reach: Employers can tap into a larger pool of candidates, while job seekers can find opportunities across different companies.
Accessibility: Job boards are typically free for job seekers to use and offer a convenient way to search for jobs online.
